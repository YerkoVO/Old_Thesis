# Datasets for Thesis: Impact on the Supply Chain of the Declaration to Triple Global Nuclear Energy Production by 2050

## **Description**:

This repository contains the datasets used in the research for the thesis titled "Impact on the Supply Chain of the Declaration to Triple Global Nuclear Energy Production by 2050". The provided data here are crucial for analyzing and assessing the anticipated effects of nuclear expansion on the global supply chain, particularly in the context of forecasting the triple global energy production by 2050 and examining the continental contributions to world electricity production.

## **Repository Structure**:

**- datasets:** Contains the original datasets used as input for models and analysis.

**- scripts:** Contains the scripts and codes used for data analysis and result generation.

**- results:** Contains the results of the analyses performed on the datasets.

**- documentation:** Contains any relevant documentation related to the datasets and analyses conducted.

## **Available Datasets**:

**World_electricity.csv:** Contains historical data on global electricity production, broken down by energy type. This data is crucial for understanding energy demand and its impact on the supply chain. It is also used to compare forecasted world electricity production by 2050 with actual data and analyze the percentage contribution of each continent to global electricity production.

**Owid.csv:** This dataset is a collection of key metrics maintained by [OWID](https://ourworldindata.org/energy), it is necessary to mention that the data used from this dataset for the development of the thesis comes from [IAEA](https://pris.iaea.org/pris/). Specific data such as nuclear power generation and nuclear electricity were extracted, retaining all countries and dates in the dataset for further analysis. This dataset is used to project the increase in global electricity production, as well as to project the tripled global nuclear power production by 2050 and assess the percentage contributions to total electricity generation by continent.
